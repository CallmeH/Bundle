# Bundle Todo Privacy Policy
updated: 2018-8-10
## Overview
Bundle Todo does not collect any user information aside from bug and crash reports (provided by __Crashlytics__, refer to [this document](https://try.crashlytics.com/terms/privacy-policy.pdf) for detailed privacy policy). No personal data (including name, gender, email, location, or any account information) will be collected.

All data regarding your todos and events is stored locally on your phone. No third party (including me!) has access to your personal data or content you stored in this app.

Happy Bundling!

With love from your developer,

Pei Qin

### *FOR THE FIRST VERSION!*

*Since this is a newly released app, Bundle Todo also incorporated the light-weight analytical tool __Answers__ (refer to [this document](https://answers.io/img/onepager/privacy.pdf) for detailed privacy policy). This service is used to track how many times all users land on different screens (these actions are called "events"). Here's an example of the report I will get:*

```
Event Name: Quit app
Count: 119 (for all users)
Event Users: 12
```

*As detailed in the example, data regarding your personal information will __not__ be collected. Your identity will __not__ be linked to any of the observed behaviors.*

*The only purpose of collecting user behavior data for this version is to improve user experience and guide development for the next release. If you do not wish to participate and help the app (and me) better understand your needs, you are always welcome to come back and install a later version.*
