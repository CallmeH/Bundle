#  Development Plan

## additional features
- link to event in calendar (so the event can have a alarm) (Me, May)
- choice of having add todo->assign event or creating event->adding multiple todos (Mags)
- drag&drop to change order
-  _a small hack: set an event to "when/I have free time"_
- sharable for teamwork (that would need to add an additional Firebase feature to make the list sharable)
- swift implement force touch actions (on homescreen, directly check-in)

## potential problems
- get user to remember to open up the app / check-in (Me, Josh, Mags, Erick)
    - use in a specific setting where time is almost set & dispatch central notification in, e.g. school (Josh)
    
    
## would be nice to have
- UI like App design awards 2018 (currency converter) (Audrey)
- color scheme choice (Me, Mags)
- tutorial (1: think about an event you are about to go to, add event, add todo+assign event, close! 2: check-in function with previous example)
- round corners and consistency!
- still want to have the ability to add time
- location reminder, routine events time-based reminder (only to open and check-in though, no specific tasks) (Aktar, Mags, Me)
- pomodoro functionality when tapped into an event
- share with family (Anna)
- profile picture? for accounts on Firebase
*** tag at tableview cell for before/when/after instead of choice beforehand


copy/duplicate/recycle events too for before/after/when
"face" like design of interface (front page)- four functional parts (add/check-in, review bundle, all todos)




horizontal picker for before/after/when swipe
