#  Polish Elements

## Color scheme/font/kerning/spacing
### logo/icon
- Design icons as glyphs. A glyph, also known as a template image, is a monochromatic image with transparency, anti-aliasing, and no drop shadow that uses a mask to define its shape. [https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/icons-and-images/custom-icons/]

## Lexicon
- keep it familiar, use system icons as intended [https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/icons-and-images/system-icons/], or design a new one


## Animation/gesture
- use existing nav bar elements or use gestures: to keep it familiar
- loading, success, failure, moving between pages/input, auto transition back with animation suggesting the action is being done, change shades on buttons/etc.

## Confirmation/notification
- after delete: undo floating window/bubble at the bottom

## Accessibility
- color blind color scheme
- alternative text labels for icons (not visible, but can be read by voice over)
- enable keyboard click sound (UIDevice.playInputClick)

## Convenience:
- continue where you left off: Restore the previous state when your app restarts. Don't make people retrace steps to reach their previous location in your app. Preserve and restore your appâ€™s state so they can continue where they left off.
